    <h2>Vehicle</h2>

    <p>
        A vehicle (from Latin: vehiculum <sup>[1]</sup>) is a machine that transports people or cargo.
        Vehicles include wagons, bicycles, motor vehicles (motorcycles, cars, trucks, buses),
        railed vehicles (trains, trams), watercraft (ships, boats), amphibious vehicles (screw-propelles vehicle, hovercraft),
        aircraft (airplanes, helicopters) and spacecraft.<sup>[2]</sup>
    </p>

    <p>
        Land vehicles are classisifed broadly by what is used to apply steering and drive forces against the ground:
        wheeled, tracked, railed or skied. ISO 3833-1977 is the standard, also internationally used in legislation,
        for road vehicles types, terms and definitions.<sup>[3]</sup>
